## Overview of the analysis

Some businesses are highly influenced by weather conditions, for example, ski resorts. 

Here a prospective business owner on Hawai'i is concerned about the weather. 

The purpose of this study is to provide an analysis of temperature differences between the months of June and December. 


## Results

Daily meteorological data from a variety of observatories on Hawai'i from 2010 to 2016 was provided in a sqlite file. Summary statistics were calculated for temperatures in June and December.

- More observations were made in June (1700) than December (1517), even though December has more days than June.

- The mean temperature in June (74.9) was 3.9 degrees greater than the mean temperature in December (71.0).

- Temperature fluctuations are greater in December than June, because the standard deviation of temperatures in December is 3.75, which is greater than the standard deviation of temperatures in June is 3.26.
